# WUOG-In-Philosophy-Checker

This is a tool I built for the college radio station I used to DJ for, 90.5FM WUOG. 
The station has specific rules about which artists can and cannot be played, so that 
the DJs stick to the philosophy that WUOG exists to give smaller artists a voice on 
the radio.

You can try the tool online [here](https://repl.it/@dospunk/WUOG-In-Philosophy-Checker)
